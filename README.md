# Restaurant Page

This is a project I created by myself as part of the Odin Project with the main objective being to use webkit and to continue practising DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>It took a while to understand the complexities of Webkit, especially before diving in and trying it myself. Things are definitely much clearer now I have done it myself.</li>
<li>I feel like I really understood how to use factory functions in this project. I used another project to try and learn to use them but in this project their usefulness was so much clearer.</li>
<li>While I didnâ€™t have any CSS goals, I am impressed by how much I can do now without being able to actually see my page. I wrote a lot of my basic CSS for different content tabs before rendering them.</li>


<h4>Mistakes to Learn From</h4>
<ul>
<li>I actually managed to complete this project easily once I could understand how webkit works. What definitely helped was looking at other projects.

In the future I will try to find a tutorial of a similar project to follow along with as this is definitely how I learn best as opposed to being overwhelmed by text articles.

<h4>Future Improvements</h4>

I might choose to use this as a portfolio project. I quite like the colour scheme and theme I have chosen but it is very simplistic right now. This is fine as the main goal was to learn webkit, not CSS. I would like to learn how to customise my own scroll bar for the menu section and to add some better stylisation for the menu. I would also like to put a map into the contact section.
